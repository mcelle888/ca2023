# e.g. math module to access pi or random to access random numbers

# when we use modules we use the import function. 
# these modules are STANDARD modules so they are available with the editor

# we can split up our programs to modules and the same modules can be applied to similar programs (custom library functions)

# SO HOW DO WE CREATE A MODULE?

# 1. create a regular python file for module and enter details
# 2. link main py file with module file
